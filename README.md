# system-call
This is adding two system call into custom Linux kernel. <br>
At first, need to download a custom Linux kernel into your computer, but I delete the link, so I will post the link when I find it. <br>
The file create two system calls called `array_stats` and `process_ancestors`

### Note: adding two system calls into real kernel, if computer has bad performace, it may take more than 4 hours to compile. Plan you time well.
